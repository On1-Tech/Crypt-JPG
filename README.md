# Crypt-JPG
New emplementation of pretty old idea - text message crypted and added to picture, and basicly invisible for people who dont dont know about it. IF you know password you can encode text from picture.  
Currently messages encryped with AES and saved as in PNG format.  
- 2020 UPDATE: Pretty serious code refactoring(it is become more readable and better written), plus found and fixed issue with LSB changes.
